# Decisions

Each decision states what was chosen and why. A decision is revisited only when
something concrete blocks progress; the reopening is recorded here.

## Accepted

### D1. Name and prefix
sxml (small XML implementation). Public prefix `sxml_`, macro prefix `SXML_`.

### D2. Core language
Portable C17 with C23 features behind macros, following `docs/C_GUIDELINES.md`.
Chosen for the widest linking reach (every platform and language can call C).
Memory-safety risk is mitigated by sanitizers, fuzzing and checked arithmetic.

### D4. License: MIT

### D5. Build on an existing engine?
Start from scratch in C. Study Xee (Rust, MIT, https://github.com/Paligo/xee)
closely: it implements most of XPath 3.1 with one IR and bytecode interpreter
shared by XPath and XSLT, the same architecture as this plan.

### D6. String representation
UTF-8, with a per-string flag for ASCII-only content so codepoint indexing is
O(1) in the common case. Codepoint count cached on first use.

### D7. Ordered maps (XDM 4.0)
XDM 4.0 maps keep insertion order. Design after Saxon 13 (Michael Kay,
"Implementing Maps for XPath 4.0", XML Prague 2026):
- a built-once list of key/value pairs plus a key-to-offset index,
  built lazily on first lookup;
- a separate persistent layer for later `map:put` / `map:remove`;
- shared key "shapes" for records;
- entries addressable by position, needed for JNode sibling navigation.

### D8. Decimal arithmetic
libmpdec (mpdecimal, BSD-2-Clause). Check whether its allocator hooks are
process-global; if so, wrap it so the no-global-state rule holds.

### D9. Regular expressions
Own engine for the XSD/XPath regex dialect, designed after Saxon HE's engine
(regexml is a Rust port that shows the approach). Check the license of any
source before porting code.

### D10. WebAssembly toolchain
WASI SDK producing a standalone module, wrapped by a small hand-written
TypeScript package. The core does no I/O of its own, so Emscripten's
JavaScript system emulation is not needed.
