# Decisions

Each decision states what was chosen and why. A decision is revisited only when
something concrete blocks progress; the reopening is recorded here.

## Accepted

### D1. Name and prefix
sxml (small XML implementation). Public prefix `sxml_`, macro prefix `SXML_`.

### D2. Core language
Portable C17 with C23 features behind macros, following `docs/C_GUIDELINES.md`.
Chosen for the widest linking reach (every platform and language can call C).
Memory-safety risk is mitigated by sanitizers, fuzzing and checked arithmetic.

### D4. License: MIT

### D5. Build on an existing engine?
Start from scratch in C. Study Xee (Rust, MIT, https://github.com/Paligo/xee)
closely: it implements most of XPath 3.1 with one IR and bytecode interpreter
shared by XPath and XSLT, the same architecture as this plan.

### D6. String representation
UTF-8, with a per-string flag for ASCII-only content so codepoint indexing is
O(1) in the common case. Codepoint count cached on first use.

### D7. Ordered maps (XDM 4.0)
XDM 4.0 maps keep insertion order. Design after Saxon 13 (Michael Kay,
"Implementing Maps for XPath 4.0", XML Prague 2026):
- a built-once list of key/value pairs plus a key-to-offset index,
  built lazily on first lookup;
- a separate persistent layer for later `map:put` / `map:remove`;
- shared key "shapes" for records;
- entries addressable by position, needed for JNode sibling navigation.

### D8. Decimal arithmetic
libmpdec (mpdecimal, BSD-2-Clause). Check whether its allocator hooks are
process-global; if so, wrap it so the no-global-state rule holds.

### D9. Regular expressions
Own engine for the XSD/XPath regex dialect, designed after Saxon HE's engine
(regexml is a Rust port that shows the approach). Check the license of any
source before porting code.

### D10. WebAssembly toolchain
WASI SDK producing a standalone module, wrapped by a small hand-written
TypeScript package. The core does no I/O of its own, so Emscripten's
JavaScript system emulation is not needed.

### D11. Phase gates closed by agent review
Recorded 2026-10-16. The project owner chose, when asked, that work proceeds
through the phases until XQuery 4.0 and XSLT 4.0 work, with each gate closed by
a separate review agent instead of a human. The review agent checks the work
against `docs/C_GUIDELINES.md` and the gate criteria; its findings are fixed
before the next phase starts. Gate boxes ticked this way are marked
"(agent review)" so a later human review can find them. The substrate freeze at
the Phase 1 gate still applies: later substrate changes need a record here.

### D12. Parsing with tree-sitter
Recorded 2026-10-16, at the owner's request ("use tree-sitter wherever you need
parsing"), confirmed for XML as well as the query languages.
- The tree-sitter runtime (MIT) is vendored under `third_party/tree-sitter/`,
  pinned to a release tag.
- Grammars live under `grammars/<language>/grammar.js`. The generated parser
  (and any external scanner) is committed so the build needs no Node.js; a
  script regenerates it with a pinned `tree-sitter-cli`.
- sxml walks the concrete syntax tree and builds its own structures (the XML
  tree arena, the XPath/XQuery abstract syntax, then the shared IR). The
  concrete syntax tree is freed before the parse function returns.
- Any `ERROR` or `MISSING` node is a static error (XML: not well-formed;
  XPath/XQuery: `XPST0003`). Error recovery never accepts input.
- What a context-free grammar cannot express (XML well-formedness constraints,
  entity expansion, namespace processing, XQuery lexical constraints) is
  checked in the tree-building step.
- Vendored third-party code is exempt from `docs/C_GUIDELINES.md` and the lint
  gates. The tree-sitter runtime allocates with `malloc` unless
  `ts_set_allocator` is called, and that hook is process-global, so sxml does
  not call it. This exemption is limited to the parse step.

### D13. Conformance test suites are fetched, not vendored
The W3C QT4 test suite (`qt4cg/qt4tests`) and the XSLT 4.0 test suite
(`qt4cg/xslt40-test`) are fetched at a pinned commit by
`tools/fetch-test-suites.sh` into `third_party/` (ignored by git). Test lists
in `tests/qt4/` refer to test cases by name.
Pinned commits: qt4tests `166453359bd7770fb113b6d9c9015df7f7fa5d02`,
xslt40-test `91328fbf0fed4a5d2813eb3661808ee53cb961ba` (both HEAD on
2026-10-16). Spec applicability: a test-case `spec` dependency replaces the
test-set one; no `spec` means all versions (see `docs/QT4_CATALOG.md`).

### D14. Build layout and presets
Recorded 2026-10-16 (task 0.1). CMake 3.24+, Ninja. Presets: `debug` (Clang,
ASan + UBSan), `debug-gcc`, `release` (default compiler), `msvc` (Visual
Studio 2022, Windows only), `wasm` (`cmake/wasi-sdk.cmake`, wrapping the SDK's
`wasi-sdk-p1.cmake`; SDK from `WASI_SDK_PREFIX` or `/opt/wasi-sdk`; WASI SDK 34
in CI). Build trees go to `build/<preset>`.
- One library target `sxml`, static by default; `-DSXML_BUILD_SHARED=ON`
  builds it shared. Public functions are marked `SXML_EXPORT`
  (`include/sxml/export.h`); project code has hidden visibility.
- `sxml_apply_project_flags(target)` applies C17 and the guideline flags
  (MSVC: `/W4 /WX`) to project targets only; `sxml_apply_third_party_flags`
  builds vendored and generated code as C11 with warnings off.
- Sanitizers (`SXML_ENABLE_SANITIZERS`) apply to every target, third-party
  included, so instrumentation sees all memory accesses.
- Each public header is compiled alone, twice included, by the
  `sxml_header_check` target (self-containment and include guard).
- WASI test executables run under Node.js (`tools/run-wasi.mjs`, set as
  `CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR`), so `ctest --preset wasm` runs the tests.
- `sxml_version_text` returns a NUL-terminated string: an external boundary.

### D15. tree-sitter pin
Recorded 2026-10-16. Runtime `v0.27.1` (commit `10eb5ac1`), copied unmodified
to `third_party/tree-sitter/` (`LICENSE`, `lib/include`, `lib/src`; details
in `third_party/tree-sitter/VERSION`). Built as `sxml_tree_sitter` from the
single unit `lib/src/lib.c` with `TREE_SITTER_FEATURE_WASM` undefined.
`tree-sitter-cli` `0.27.1` is pinned in `tools/package.json`
(`npm ci --prefix tools`); `tools/generate-grammars.sh` regenerates
`grammars/<language>/src/` and `sxml_add_grammar(<language>)`
(`cmake/SxmlGrammar.cmake`) builds it as `sxml_grammar_<language>`. Runtime
and CLI versions move together.

### D16. Unit test harness
Recorded 2026-10-16 (task 0.2). `tests/test_runner.h` and `.c`, no
dependencies. One executable per module, `tests/<module>_test.c`, holding a
static `sxml_test_case` array passed to `sxml_test_run_suite` from `main`;
registered as one ctest test named `<module>` by `sxml_add_test(<module>)` in
`tests/CMakeLists.txt`. Checks: `SXML_TEST_EXPECT` (continue) and
`SXML_TEST_REQUIRE` (return from the case). Case names given on the command
line run only those cases. Tests may include `src/*_internal.h`.

### D17. Lint gates
Recorded 2026-10-16 (task 0.3). `tools/lint.sh` runs the ast-grep rule
self-tests and the `lint` CMake target (`lint-clang-tidy` + `lint-ast-grep`)
in the `debug` build tree. clang-tidy covers `src/`, `tests/` and the header
check units; `.clang-tidy` header filter now also covers `tests/`. ast-grep
(`@ast-grep/cli` `0.45.3`, pinned in `tools/package.json`) rules in
`tools/ast-grep/rules/`, with examples in `tools/ast-grep/tests/`:
banned abbreviations and single-letter names (as a whole name or one
snake_case word), allocation outside `src/allocator.c`, abort/exit/printing in
`src/`, more than three parameters (variadic counts), bare `bool` parameters.
The guideline rule "pointer parameters without a length" is not yet a lint:
it needs the view types from task 0.5 first.

### D18. Continuous integration
Recorded 2026-10-16 (task 0.4). `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: Linux Clang
(`debug`, plus lints) and GCC (`debug-gcc`), macOS Clang (`debug`), Windows
MSVC (`msvc`, build only), WASI (`wasm`, tests under Node.js 22). Lints run
on Linux Clang only.
