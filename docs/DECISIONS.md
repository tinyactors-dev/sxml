# Decisions

Each decision states what was chosen and why. A decision is revisited only when
something concrete blocks progress; the reopening is recorded here.

## Accepted

### D1. Name and prefix
sxml (small XML implementation). Public prefix `sxml_`, macro prefix `SXML_`.

### D2. Core language
Portable C17 with C23 features behind macros, following `docs/C_GUIDELINES.md`.
Chosen for the widest linking reach (every platform and language can call C).
Memory-safety risk is mitigated by sanitizers, fuzzing and checked arithmetic.

### D4. License: MIT

### D5. Build on an existing engine?
Start from scratch in C. Study Xee (Rust, MIT, https://github.com/Paligo/xee)
closely: it implements most of XPath 3.1 with one IR and bytecode interpreter
shared by XPath and XSLT, the same architecture as this plan.

### D6. String representation
UTF-8, with a per-string flag for ASCII-only content so codepoint indexing is
O(1) in the common case. Codepoint count cached on first use.

### D7. Ordered maps (XDM 4.0)
XDM 4.0 maps keep insertion order. Design after Saxon 13 (Michael Kay,
"Implementing Maps for XPath 4.0", XML Prague 2026):
- a built-once list of key/value pairs plus a key-to-offset index,
  built lazily on first lookup;
- a separate persistent layer for later `map:put` / `map:remove`;
- shared key "shapes" for records;
- entries addressable by position, needed for JNode sibling navigation.

### D8. Decimal arithmetic
libmpdec (mpdecimal, BSD-2-Clause). Check whether its allocator hooks are
process-global; if so, wrap it so the no-global-state rule holds.

### D9. Regular expressions
Own engine for the XSD/XPath regex dialect, designed after Saxon HE's engine
(regexml is a Rust port that shows the approach). Check the license of any
source before porting code.

### D10. WebAssembly toolchain
WASI SDK producing a standalone module, wrapped by a small hand-written
TypeScript package. The core does no I/O of its own, so Emscripten's
JavaScript system emulation is not needed.

### D11. Phase gates closed by agent review
Recorded 2026-10-16. The project owner chose, when asked, that work proceeds
through the phases until XQuery 4.0 and XSLT 4.0 work, with each gate closed by
a separate review agent instead of a human. The review agent checks the work
against `docs/C_GUIDELINES.md` and the gate criteria; its findings are fixed
before the next phase starts. Gate boxes ticked this way are marked
"(agent review)" so a later human review can find them. The substrate freeze at
the Phase 1 gate still applies: later substrate changes need a record here.

### D12. Parsing with tree-sitter
Recorded 2026-10-16, at the owner's request ("use tree-sitter wherever you need
parsing"), confirmed for XML as well as the query languages.
- The tree-sitter runtime (MIT) is vendored under `third_party/tree-sitter/`,
  pinned to a release tag.
- Grammars live under `grammars/<language>/grammar.js`. The generated parser
  (and any external scanner) is committed so the build needs no Node.js; a
  script regenerates it with a pinned `tree-sitter-cli`.
- sxml walks the concrete syntax tree and builds its own structures (the XML
  tree arena, the XPath/XQuery abstract syntax, then the shared IR). The
  concrete syntax tree is freed before the parse function returns.
- Any `ERROR` or `MISSING` node is a static error (XML: not well-formed;
  XPath/XQuery: `XPST0003`). Error recovery never accepts input.
- What a context-free grammar cannot express (XML well-formedness constraints,
  entity expansion, namespace processing, XQuery lexical constraints) is
  checked in the tree-building step.
- Vendored third-party code is exempt from `docs/C_GUIDELINES.md` and the lint
  gates. The tree-sitter runtime allocates with `malloc` unless
  `ts_set_allocator` is called, and that hook is process-global, so sxml does
  not call it. This exemption is limited to the parse step.

### D13. Conformance test suites are fetched, not vendored
The W3C QT4 test suite (`qt4cg/qt4tests`) and the XSLT 4.0 test suite
(`qt4cg/xslt40-test`) are fetched at a pinned commit by
`tools/fetch-test-suites.sh` into `third_party/` (ignored by git). Test lists
in `tests/qt4/` refer to test cases by name.
